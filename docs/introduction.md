# Introduction to Talon

**Talon Hunt Framework** is a standardized collection of saved searches designed for native import into CrowdStrike Falcon. It enables streamlined threat hunting, detection engineering, and incident response activities with **zero external dependencies**.

## The Problem
Security teams often struggle with:
* Inconsistent query syntax across analysts.
* Lack of version control for detection logic.
* Difficulty replicating hunts across different environments.

## The Talon Solution
Talon leverages the power of **CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL)** to provide analysts and engineers with a unified framework. 

### Key Capabilities
1.  **Standardization:** Establish a common language across security teams.
2.  **CI/CD Integration:** Treat your detection logic as code.
3.  **Speed:** Native queries mean faster execution and immediate results within the Falcon console.

> "Talon ensures that your hunt and detection workflows remain consistent, version-controlled, and production-ready."

## Getting Started
To begin using Talon, ensure you have access to your CrowdStrike Falcon instance and review the [Architecture](/guide/architecture) page.
